**YeNo**
=====
Introduction
---------------
Answering questions takes time. But there are many questions for which weâ€™d require an answer in an instant for it to be relevant. 

To solve this problem, we made an app called YeNo. Developed as an OnePlus Hackathon project, this application lets users ask questions to any person at a particular location for which the answer can either be a yes or a no. Is there queue at Starbucks? Is it raining in Electronic City Bangalore? Does McDonalds in Delhi serve veg burgers? This application lets one get answers to such questions (and lots more) in an instant from people who probably are aware of their surroundings. Answering questions just requires a person to click either yes or a no on their Android Wear device or the lock screen notification of their phone. 

This ability to respond just by clicking a button without having to unlock the phone is what makes it possible to answer and get answers in an instant.
